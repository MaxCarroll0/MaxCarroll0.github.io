I've just landed in Singapore to attend my first conference, the world leading [ICFP/SPLASH 2025](https://conf.researchr.org/home/icfp-splash-2025), over the coming week. Looking forward to broadening my horizons on the state of research in programming language design, theory, and implementation; there looks to be many interesting talks in the program. I'll be documenting my thoughts on some of what I see in the next few days.

I'll also be giving my first (25m) [talk](site/talks/hatra25) on Tuesday!! The talk is based on research conducted during my undergraduate [dissertation](site/papers/dissertation) at Cambridge and will take place at the [HATRA 25](LINK) (Human Aspects of Types and Reasoning Assistants) workshop. [My work](site/papers/hatra25) aims to improve both understanding and debugging of [bidirectional type systems](tag/bidirectional types)<fn>See Jana Dunfield's and Neel Krishnaswami's [brilliant introduction](https://doi.org/10.1145/3450952).</fn> by creating _interactive_ highlighting methods inspired by program slicing<fn>Especially that of [Roly Perera](https://dynamicaspects.org/research/). '[Functional Programs that Explain their Work](https://doi.org/10.1145/2364527.2364579)' is a good introduction.</fn>.
