I didn't log many of the talks on the final couple of days but the [OCaml Users and Developers Workshop](https://conf.researchr.org/home/icfp-splash-2025/ocaml-2025) had several great talks, mang of which were very practical coming from a more development-oriented approach, which was a nice change from much of the rest of the conference. Also, the [Haskell Symposium](https://conf.researchr.org/home/icfp-splash-2025/haskellsymp-2025) had some great, more theoretical, talks.

I'm now heading back to Cambridge to go straight into yet more programming languages seminars with jetlag and to catch up all the university work I've missed while out in Singapore...
